        <h1>EVIDENCES</h1>
        <h2>EVIDENCE OF THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
        <p>
            -The universe began with an explosion of space itself the Big Bang. Starting from extremely high density and temperature, space expanded, the universe cooled, and the simplest elements formed.<br><br>
            -Galactic Redshifts and “Hubble’s Law,” the phenomenon whereby galaxies appear to be moving away from the Earth at speeds roughly proportional to their distance.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>CMB</h2>
        <p>
            -The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is leftover radiation from the Big Bang or the time when the universe began. As the theory goes, when the universe was born it underwent rapid inflation, expansion and cooling. (The universe is still expanding today, and the expansion rate appears different depending on where you look). The CMB represents the heat leftover from the Big Bang.<br><br>
            -You can't see the CMB with your naked eye, but it is everywhere in the universe. It is invisible to humans because it is so cold, just 2.725 degrees above absolute zero (minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 273.15 degrees Celsius.) This means its radiation is most visible in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>DOPPLER</h2>
        <p>
            -Something similar happens to sound waves when a source of sound moves relative to an observer. This effect is called the 'Doppler effect' after Christian Andreas Doppler, an Austrian mathematician who discovered that the frequency of sound waves changes if the source of sound and the observer are moving relative to each other.<br><br>
            -If the two are approaching, then the frequency heard by the observer is higher; if they move away from each other, the frequency heard is lower.<br><br>
            -There are many everyday examples of the Doppler effect - the changing pitch of police and ambulance sirens, or train whistles and racing car engines as they pass by.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>REDSHIFT</h2>
        <p>
            -Distant galaxies looked redder than those nearby. Moreover, the further away they are, the redder they tend to look. This observation, known as redshift, allowed us to measure the distances to galaxies too distant to determine by other means. It was also revealed that the universe is expanding, with all its components flying apart from each other unless they are close enough that gravity holds them together.<br><br>
            -Light also travels in waves, with red light having longer wavelengths than blue. The same bunching on approach and spread on departing occurs. When the waves spread out they are referred to as “redshifted”. However, because light in a vacuum travels almost a million times faster than sound in air, it is necessary for a source to be moving very fast before the shift is noticeable.<br><br>
            -That’s why, despite the physicists’ jokey bumper sticker reading, “If this sticker looks blue you’re traveling too fast”, we hear, but don’t see, the Doppler effect in our everyday lives.<br><br>
