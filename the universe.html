        <h1>THE UNIVERSE</h1>
        <h2>ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
        <p>
            -The cosmos began 13.7 billion years ago with the big bang. A fraction of a second after the beginning, the universe was a hot, formless soup of the most elementary particles, quarks and leptons. As it expanded and cooled, layer on layer of structure developed: neutrons and protons, atomic nuclei, atoms, stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and finally superclusters. The observable part of the universe is now inhabited by 100 billion galaxies, each containing 100 billion stars and probably a similar number of planets. Galaxies themselves are held together by the gravity of the mysterious dark matter. The universe continues to expand and indeed does so at an accelerating pace, driven by dark energy, an even more mysterious form of energy whose gravitational force repels rather than attracts.<br><br>
            -When you have a celestial object with at least one other thing orbiting it, you can call that whole thing a system. The Earth and Moon together, along with any other objects orbiting Earth, can be called the Earth system (or sometimes the Earth/Moon system). The Earth system travels as one unit through space.<br><br>
            -There are eight major planets (that we know of) and many smaller objects orbiting the Sun. The Sun and everything that orbits it make up the Solar System, i.e. the system that is centered around the Sun (solar system = sun system).<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS PART OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY</h2>
        <P>
            -The Solar System and all the neighbouring planetary systems are part of a galaxy we call the Milky Way. This galaxy is made up of an estimated 200 billion stars, most of which have planetary systems. Remember that you can only see a few thousand of these stars with your own eyes so you're only looking at a very small part of the Milky Way.<br><br>
            -The Milky Way is shaped like a disc with a bright bulge in the middle surrounding the galactic center. The bulge is caused by a higher density of stars near the middle of the disc.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>THE MILKY WAY GALAXY IS PART OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
        <p>
            -The Milky Way is one of at least 100 billion galaxies in the known Universe. Each galaxy is made of billions of stars and planetary systems.<br><br>
            -The Milky Way, a fairly typical galaxy, is surrounded by a number of dwarf galaxies that appear to orbit our galaxy. The closest similar galaxy to ours is Andromeda, about 2.5 million light-years away and also surrounded by dwarf galaxies. The galaxies shown below, along with a few others, make up a set of galaxies called the Local Group.<br><br>
            -At this point you start seeing the large-scale structure of the Universe in which clusters and superclusters of galaxies are arranged in a pattern of filament structures. This is pretty much how the Universe looks as far into the distance as we can see.<br><br>
            HOW DID THE UNIVERSE ORIGINATE?<br><br>
            -The universe began with a period of inflation that started about 13.8 billion years ago. The universe was initially permeated only by energy, which congealed into particles that assembled into light atoms like hydrogen and helium. These atoms clumped first into galaxies, then stars, inside whose fiery furnaces all the other elements were forged.<br><br>
            -While the Big Bang theory is widely accepted as the most plausible explanation for the universe’s origin, it is still a mystery what caused the explosion in the first place. Theories attempting to solve this mystery are becoming increasingly complex, and scientists are haunted by the possibility that some of the most critical links in their chain of reasoning are wrong.<br><br>
        </P>
        <h2>BIG CRUNCH</h2>
        <p>
            -Possible fate of the universe<br><br>
            -The Big Crunch is one of the scenarios predicted by scientists in which the Universe may end. Just like many others, it is based on Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity. That is, if the Big Bang describes how the Universe most possibly began, the Big Crunch describes how it will end as a consequence of that beginning.<br><br>
            -It tells us that the Universe’s expansion, which is due to the Big Bang, will not continue forever. Instead, at a certain point in time, it will stop expanding and collapse into itself, pulling everything with it until it eventually turns into the biggest black hole ever. Well, we all know how everything is squeezed when in that hole. Hence the name Big Crunch.<br><br>
