        <h2>FACTS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE</h2>
        <p>
            1. There are ten times as many stars in the known universe as there are grains of sand in the world. Astronomers say that there are 70 thousand million million million stars visible from the Earth through telescopes.<br>
            2. A typical galaxy may contain anywhere between about ten million and one trillion stars. Galaxies are of three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars.<br>
            3. The diameter of the observable universe is about 93.016 billion light years. This is approximately 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles (500 sextillion miles).<br>
            4. According to some physicists, there could be multiple universes, so we might be living in a multiverse.<br>
            5. A “light year” is a measure of distance, not time. It is defined as the distance light travels in one year. Light moves at a velocity of about 300,000 kilometers each second, so in one year, it travels about 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers.<br>
            6. Scientists estimate that the shape of the universe looks a lot like a brain cell.<br>
            7. A neutron star is the strongest magnet in the universe.<br>
